=============================
Google Mobile Ads SDK for iOS
=============================

This is v7.0.0 of the Google Mobile Ads SDK for iOS.

Requirements:
- Xcode 5.1 or later.
- iOS deployment target of iOS 6.0 or later.

The latest documentation and code samples are available at:
https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/

NOTE: The original is released as a framework. We extract the contents
and use it as a static library for sake of simplicity. This includes
the need to fix many of the import references in the library's headers.
All of this may not be necessary; you may want to try to use the
framework as is during the next SDK update.
